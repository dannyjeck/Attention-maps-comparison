## Abstract

## Code Usage

main_script.m generates Figure 3 from the paper (the main result). Modifying binsize (line 23) to 256 generates figure 5.

The correlation values under the sample error hypothesis are computed using R_samp_err.m

R_samp_err_validation.m is the code used to show that the p-values generated by the test of the sample-error hypothesis are valid (Figure S2).

* histf.m
* phistf.m (modified slightly by me from histf.m)
* herrorbar.m
* portions of gen_maps.m copied from previous code by Chris Masciocchi
